### Breakdown:

1. **Imports**: 
    - **`urllib.request`**: Used to download PDF files from a URL.
    - **`fitz`**: Part of the PyMuPDF package, used for working with PDF documents.
    - **`re`**: Regular expressions library, used for text preprocessing.
    - **`numpy`**: A popular numerical library, used for working with arrays.
    - **`tensorflow_hub`**: TensorFlow Hub is a library for reusable machine learning models. In this case, it is used to load the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) model.
    - **`openai`**: The OpenAI API library, used to interact with the GPT-3 API.
    - **`gradio`**: A library for creating web-based user interfaces for Python applications.
    
2. **PDF Processing Functions**: The app has several functions for downloading and processing PDF documents:
    - **`download_pdf(url, output_path)`**: Downloads a PDF file from a given URL and saves it to the specified output path.
    - **`preprocess(text)`**: Cleans up the text by replacing newline characters and reducing multiple spaces.
    - **`pdf_to_text(path, start_page=1, end_page=None)`**: Converts a PDF document to a list of strings, where each string represents the text on a page.
    - **`text_to_chunks(texts, word_length=150, start_page=1)`**: Splits the text from each page into chunks of a specified word length.

3. **SemanticSearch Class**: This class is responsible for creating a semantic search engine using the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) model. It has several methods:
    - **`__init__()`**: Initializes the class and loads the USE model.
    - **`fit(data, batch=1000, n_neighbors=5)`**: Fits the NearestNeighbors model on the provided data (text chunks).
    - **`__call__(text, return_data=True)`**: Finds the nearest neighbors for a given text query and returns the related text chunks.
    - **`get_text_embedding(texts, batch=1000)`**: Computes the embeddings for the given texts using the USE model.

4. **Load and Initialize Recommender**: The code initializes a **`SemanticSearch`** object called **`recommender`** and provides a function **`load_recommender(path, start_page=1)`** to load a PDF and fit the recommender on the PDF content.
5. **GPT-3 Text Generation**: The **`generate_text(prompt, engine="text-davinci-003")`** and **`generate_answer(question)`** functions are responsible for interacting with the GPT-3 API and generating answers based on the provided question and PDF content.
6. **Web Interface**: Gradio library creates a web interface with URL, PDF file, and question input fields, and an answer output. The function **`question_answer(url, file, question, api_key)`** manages PDF download, text processing, GPT-3 answer generation, and result display.
